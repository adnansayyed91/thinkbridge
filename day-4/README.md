### Session 1 – Review

1. Revised HTML fundamentals (Day 1) → document structure, semantic elements, forms, tables.

2. Revised CSS basics (Day 2) → syntax, selectors, box model, typography, colors, integration.

3. Revised CSS layout systems (Day 3) → Flexbox, positioning, responsive patterns.

4. Practiced recalling concepts before moving to JavaScript basics.


### Session 02 – JavaScript Basics

1. Practiced JavaScript fundamentals:
   - Variables & Constants (`let`, `const`)
   - Strings (concatenation, template literals, methods)
   - Arrays (creation, indexing, common methods)
   - Objects (properties, methods, nested objects)
   - Conditionals (`if-else`, `switch`)
   - Loops (`for`, `while`, `for...of`)

2. Created exercise file:
   - `session-02/src/js/basics.js` → contains solved code snippets for each concept

3. Documentation:
   - `js-basics.md` → explanations with code examples for revision


### Session 03 – DOM and Events Overview

1. Learned how to interact with the DOM:
   - Selected elements using `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
   - Updated elements by changing text (`textContent`), styles (`style.fontSize`), and classes (`classList.add`).

2. Practiced adding event listeners:
   - `click` event on a button to update a message.
   - Toggle button example → switched background color and text based on state.

3. Created files:
   - `session-03/src/dom.js` → script for DOM selection, updates, and events.
   - `dom-notes.md` → notes summarizing DOM methods and event handling.


### Session 04 – DevTools & Debugging

1. Explored Chrome DevTools features:
   - Console → checked errors and tested DOM commands directly.
   - Sources → set breakpoints, paused code execution, inspected variables.
   - Watch expressions & Call stack → monitored values and flow.

2. Debugging practice:
   - Stepped through event listener functions to observe variable changes.


3. Explored VS Code Debugging:
   - Created `debug-example.js` with sample functions (`greet`, `addNumbers`).
   - Added breakpoints and stepped through code using VS Code Debug Panel
   - Used launch.json to configure debugging with Node.js.
   - Inspected variables and execution flow directly in VS Code.

4. Deliverables:
   - Debugging practice done live in Chrome DevTools.
   - Short recording showing a debug session in DevTools and VS Code.
