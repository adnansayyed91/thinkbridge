# Day 5 - Session 2: GitHub Consolidation

## Objective
Consolidate all previous exercises into a single GitHub repository (`thinkbridge`) for easy access and tracking.

## Tasks
1. Create a single repository called `thinkbridge`.
2. Move all previous day folders (day-1 to day-4) into this repository with proper folder structure:
    thinkbridge/
    day-1/
    session-1/
    session-2/
    ...
    day-2/
    session-1/
    session-2/
    ...
    ...
3. Invite collaborator `sganesh1975` to the repository.
4. Revoke permissions from old repositories (`day-2`, `day-3`, `day-4`).
5. Sign up on Harmony Engine.
6. Create a project with your name (e.g., `Adnan Sayyed`).
7. Add `sai@thinkbridge.com` as a collaborator.
8. Connect GitHub and select the `thinkbridge` repository to sync and process codebase.

## Deliverables
- Consolidated repository `thinkbridge` on GitHub
- Harmony Engine project linked to the repository
