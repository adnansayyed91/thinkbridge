# Day 5 - Session 3: Functions, Scope & Objects

## Objective
Practice JavaScript functions, understand block and function scope, and create objects with properties and methods.

## Topics Covered
- Function declarations and expressions
- Arrow functions
- Block scope (`let`, `const`) vs function scope (`var`)
- Creating objects with properties and methods
- Iterating over object properties
- Nested objects and arrays

## Activities
- Wrote multiple examples of function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
- Explored variable scoping using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Created objects with properties, methods, and nested structures
- Iterated object properties using `for...in` loops
- Experimented with nested objects and arrays

## Deliverables
- `src/js/functions.js` → contains function examples and scope demonstrations
- `src/js/objects.js` → contains object creation, property access, and iteration examples
